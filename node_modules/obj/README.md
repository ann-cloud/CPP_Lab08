# obj

Object chaining tools.

WIP, things will change.

## Usage

```js
var o = require('obj');

o({ foo: 'bar' })
  .clone()
  .set('bar', 'baz')
  .sub('baz')
    .set('some', 'value')
    .out()
  .get();
// => { foo: 'bar', bar: 'baz', baz: { some: 'value' } }

o({ foo: 'bar' }).clone().get();
// => { foo: 'bar' }
```

Here is the `clone` implementation:

```js
o.prototype.clone = function () {
  return this
    .tmp({})
    .parEach(function (k, v) { this.set(k, v) });
};
```

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install obj
```
