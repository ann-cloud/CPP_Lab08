## Usage

Here's the code for the three examples above:

```js
var osm = require('osm');

// show a map of the current position
var map = osm();
document.body.appendChild(map.show());

// show a map of a fixed position
map = osm().position(47.88038, 10.6222475);
document.body.appendChild(map.show());

// show a map of the current position with a custom radius
map = osm().radius(0.008);
document.body.appendChild(map.show());
```

### [Try it out on requirebin](http://requirebin.com/?gist=6074401)

## API

### osm()

Create a new `osm` instance.

### osm#position(lat, lon)

Set the position to (`lat`, `long`). If you don't call this method `osm` will
try to get the current position using the geolocation api.

This method is chainable.

### osm#radius(radius)

Set the map's radius in degrees. If you don't call this method, it defaults to
`0.002`.

This method is chainable.

### osm#show()

Return the map's dom element.

### osm#on('position', fn)

`fn` gets called when `position` is set via `osm#position` or retrieved using
the browser's geolocation api.

### osm#on('error', fn)

If there's an error requesting the user's geolocation, `fn` will be called
with it.

## Installation

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
$ npm install osm
```

Then bundle for the client using [browserify](http://browserify.org/).
